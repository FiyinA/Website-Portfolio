This folder should contain your resume PDF file named "resume.pdf".

To add your resume:
1. Export your resume as a PDF
2. Name the file: resume.pdf
3. Place it in this /public folder (f:\Coding Projects\Portfolio\public\resume.pdf)

Once placed here, the "Download Resume" button on the website will automatically serve it.
When the site is hosted (e.g. on Vercel or Netlify), the file in /public is served at the root URL,
so the link /resume.pdf will work correctly for visitors to download.
